#
# To convert from binary to base 10, we take the sum of each digit multiplied by
# two raised to the power of its index. For example:

  # false are not. Hash#select then returns the new hash.

  #
  # Write a method with the functionality of Hash#merge. Your Hash#my_merge method

# The Lucas series is a sequence of integers that extends infinitely in both
# positive and negative directions.
#
# The first two numbers in the Lucas series are 2 and 1. A Lucas number can
# be calculated as the sum of the previous two numbers in the sequence.
# A Lucas number can also be calculated as the difference between the next
# two numbers in the sequence.
#
# All numbers in the Lucas series are indexed. The number 2 is
# located at index 0. The number 1 is located at index 1, and the number -1 is
# located at index -1. You might find the chart below helpful:
#
# Lucas series: ...-11,  7,  -4,  3,  -1,  2,  1,  3,  4,  7,  11...
# Indices:      ... -5, -4,  -3, -2,  -1,  0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5...
#
# Write a method that takes an input N and returns the number at the Nth index
# position of the Lucas series.

  # return 2 if n == 0
  # return 1 if n == 1
  # if n > 0
